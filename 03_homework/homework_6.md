**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


**Security and Ethics**

Thinking of all I've done so far from an ethical perspective, ensuring the privacy and security of the data stored in the database is crucial. This includes implementing robust encryption methods, access controls, and regular audits to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. 

Additionally, ethical data collection practices must be enforced, ensuring that individuals' consent is obtained before their data is included in the database and that they are informed about how their data will be used. This transparency fosters trust and respects users' rights to their information.

Addressing inequity involves evaluating how different user groups interact with the database and ensuring it respects the rights of all the stakeholders. Also, ensuring that the database's interface is user-friendly for people with varying levels of technological proficiency can help bridge the digital divide in the workplace.

I would conduct an ethical impact assessment to identify potential risks and mitigation strategies engaging with diverse stakeholders. In this concrete case, data professionals, customers, and vendors.
